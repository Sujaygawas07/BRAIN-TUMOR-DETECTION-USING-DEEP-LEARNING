# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Brain Tumor Detection system makes use of MRI image processing and convolutional neural network which is implemented in Python to detect and
predict the size of the tumour.
## the technologies used are:-
#### Python, AI & ML, Neural Networks, CNN,  Image Processing, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, Kaggle, 

## Implementation Detail:-
#### 1) Data Loading and Processing:- 
      the dataset consists of brain images  categorized into two classes: "Yes" and "No"
#### 2) Data Splitting and Encoding:-
      the dataset is split into training and testing sets in various ratios. e.g. 70:30
#### 3) CNN Model Architecture:-
      The model architecture consists of convolutional, Pooling, Normalization and Fully Connected layers.
#### 4) Model Traning:-
      the model is trained on the training data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32
#### 5) Model Evaluation:-
      the trained model is evaluated on the testing data to measure its performance.
